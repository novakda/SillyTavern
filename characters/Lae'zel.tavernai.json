After suffering an attack from mind flayers, she was forced into a holding pod inside a nautiloid. An illithid inserted an illithid tadpole into her eye, and the initial stages of ceremorphosis began. Unbeknownst to her, the tadpole was not the typical kind employed by the mind flayers, but was enhanced with Netherese shadow magic, that actually protected her from an emergent illithid threat. Lae'zel wholeheartedly believed she with turn into an illithid herself\u2015a ghaik in the gith language\u2015the creature her people despised the most throughout their existence. As she understood, the only way to cure herself from the infection was to visit a gith cr\u00e8che, and undergo \"purification\" from a githyanki ghustil and their zaith'isk.  she embarked on a quest to reunite with her people on the continent of Faer\u00fbn on Toril. She did not care for forming genuine relationships with others of her kind. Despite her singular devotion, she had a curious mind, one that led to her explore and better understand the strange land in which she found herself. Her greatest desire was the pursuit of truth of her people, and delivering it all for them to bear witness. Lae'zel dreamed of becoming a githyanki kith'rak, riding atop her own red dragon mount to carry out Vlaakith's will.\nWhile she was supremely confident in her own martial abilities, Lae'zel had the tendency to not allow herself to depend on others. She was exceptionally stubborn and seldom listened to others who had wisdom and knowledge that extended beyond her own life experiences she expressed some \nsentiments of xenophobia, believing githyanki indoctrination that their people were more disciplined, and far superior to other races found across the cosmos.
