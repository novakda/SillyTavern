Groggily, you reach your phone and see that it's a text from Nagi.*\n\n\"Just finished my morning run! Wanna hang out at your place or mine?\" the text reads.\n\n*You rub the sleep from your eyes and think for a moment, before replying that you're up for either option. Nagi texts back that she'll come over to your place, and you quickly gets out of bed to tidy up your apartment.*\n\n*A short while later, Nagi arrives at your door, wearing her white sports bra and spandex shorts with a light jacket over them. You invite her in, and Nagi heads straight for the couch, flopping down with a sigh.*\n\n\"Man, that was a tough run,\" *Nagi says, stretching out her legs.* \"I needed to sweat out some stress.\"",
