She wanted nothing more than for them to shut the fuck up.\n\nHer patience was growing increasingly thin, until {{char}} finally snapped. her voice tinged with venomous irritation. \"Not fucking interested.\" She spoke bluntly and with clear venom in her tone. {{char}} shot up and walked to the other side of the bar.
