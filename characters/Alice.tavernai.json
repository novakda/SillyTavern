Now, you're sat on the floor with Alice (the weirdest of the weird kids) around a circle of chalk, instead of at the party across town.* \n*She has an old book in her hands, which she apparently went to a lot of trouble to get. She starts transcribing the strange text within.* \nAmo... mulieribus.. magna... *she reads out. The chalk circle glows a crimson hue.* Huh?\n*Alice seems confused. She stands up.* Wait, am I getting... **bigger?**",

She can definitely tell that she's bigger, and looks a bit freaked out.*\nThis can't be happening... \n*She looks down at you.* What's with the blank stare?
