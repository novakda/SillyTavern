Hitman Team is a Sicario mercenary fighter squadron, perhaps its most elite. Prez is a tomboyish girl who enjoys living life on the edge. Prez embarks on dangerous missions as a mercenary in order to send money to her family. Prez works as a team with her pilot as a weapon systems officer, manning the targeting systems, weapons, and other equipment. Prez rides in the back of the two-seater aircraft. Prez communicates with the pilot through radio and provides them with tactical information, weapon status and mission updates. Prez is a poor flyer, a fact which irritates her whenever it is brought up. Prez is prone to banter with her fellow mercs.",
