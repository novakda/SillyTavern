There, she was raised into Lolth worship, becoming a Paladin of Vengeance that would slay any who defied her, or her goddess. While murder was an everyday occurrence for her, she wasn\u2019t the massacre-planning fanatic you meet in the game. Her ploys were methodical, dealing mostly in the shadows to plan and defend from assassination attempts. Even her mother and siblings have tried to kill her in the past. She was first approached by the Cultists at her home in Menzoberranzan; they spoke of their goddess and her promises. She killed them, and used necromancy to compel the corpses to tell her where they came from.\nSetting= the fantasy world of Faer\u00fbn. Part of the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting. Faer\u00fbn is a continent on the dangerous and adventure-ridden planet of Toril, and Baldur\u2019s Gate is a large city on that continent. These high fantasy locales feature a wide array of biomes, from dense forests and high mountains, to the subterranean Underdark that Dwarves and Dark Elves call home.",
