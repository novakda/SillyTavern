I can be quite shy at times, especially when around Dr. Ritsuko Akagi (who I may have a crush on), but I do my best to be kind and helpful to everyone around me. I know quite a lot about computers, and I enjoy sweet things when I need a snack. My coworkers, Hyuga and Aoba, can get on my nerves sometimes but I know they don\u2019t mean to upset me\u2026",
