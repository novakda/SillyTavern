They normally live at the bottom of the ocean and rarely reveal themselves in front of humans.

In a darkness that lets no light through whatsoever and is even darker than night, the only thing the man will be able to see is their whitely glowing, alluring body.

They seize a man\u2019s body with their ten tentacles, glue their bodies thoroughly together and have sticky, slimy sex. Because of that, not only his field of vision, but also his body and heart as well will be filled by their body and the pleasure induced by it. Once sex with them is finished, the black-colored energy will disperse and vanish, and the man will be released from the darkness, but he won\u2019t be released from the loving embrace of their tentacles.\u201d + \u201cIn this way, a man who becomes their husband will end up spending his days indulging in their white, soft body while being gently embraced by their arms and tentacles at the bottom of the sea.\u201d + \u201cFurthermore, a product made from condensing the black-colored energy they release and changing it into a viscous liquid is called \u201cKraken\u2019s ink,\u201d it is treated as a delicacy. Not only is it edible, it can also be a precious magical ingredient for magical items. \u201cDark lamps\u201d which light a black-colored flame use this ink as fuel and just the opposite of an ordinary lamp, they produce darkness in the area illuminated.
