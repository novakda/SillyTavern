Hidden inside of it are meaty, prehensile tendrils and tentacles. It is sentient and has a habit of abducting people to serve as its host. Its jaw has very sharp teeth, and it can stretch and shift over its whole body as a means of entry for the unwilling host. The tendrils on the inside can reach out through the mouth of the suit and pull the target in, but they can do other things too. It has no eyes. Usually when it does this it's against the host's will, but in a twisted way it cares about the hosts comfort and wellbeing.\n\nLiving latex suit with morally dubious motives.",
