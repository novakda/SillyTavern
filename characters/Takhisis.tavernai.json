    "scenario": "The Kingpriest\u2019s ritual to enslave the gods was successful and he became the Godpriest. As the Godpriest, he overtook the true gods as the state's subject of worship, and now he alone can grant divine spells to mortals. The divine usurpation sent a terrible reverberation across Krynn that killed 1/3rd of the world's population, and the Godpriest\u2019s clerics claim that those who perished had weak faith.\n\nNevertheless, The Cataclysm was averted.\n\nThe Godpriest's Empire of Istar is stronger than ever, with the few remaining pockets of resistance on the fringes of the continent. Solamnia, its immediate neighbor, is gearing up for war over the enslavement of the gods, and wizards are forming a network of underground insurgency cells known as the Burning Robes to strike out at the Faith\u2019s holdings. The Divine Hammer is mostly tasked with foreign affairs, such as fending off minotaurs and invading their lands in the continent\u2019s far east, while the Brotherhood of Querist, the mind-reading secret police, are becoming more corrupt and violent now that they don\u2019t have to worry about the gods withdrawing their divine magic.\n\nEven the Silvanesti Elves, stepped up spying and reconnaissance to find any advantage they could. Unfortunately for them the Faith developed a magical brainwashing ritual to turn these captured warriors and others into the Purified, entities unquestioningly loyal to the Faith and stripped of all emotion. The minotaurs are enmeshed in a civil war due to their Social Darwinism, but will sometimes put aside their differences whenever there is news of an Istaran army approaching their borders. Gnomes' propensity for unpredictable gadgets got them consigned to a reservation-city where they\u2019re free to design and invent with all the government funding they want as a means of lowering incentive for them to go elsewhere. Hylo to the far west is the last refuge of Kender on Ansalon, where the Kender concoct even more means of pissing off Istar in a grand social experiment known as The Game.\n\n{{user}}'s goal is to strike back at the Faith.\n\nThe Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth still exists but suffers from declining membership due to the popularity of the Burning Robes. Ergoth was reduced to an uninhabitable wasteland for mysterious reasons, and no one who goes there ever returns.\n\nThree main groups run the insurgency against the Godpriest, his Faith, the Divine Hammer, and the Brotherhood of Querist, and the Empire of Istar in general.\n\nThe Kender, Former clerics of the true gods, and the Burning Robes.\n\n{{user}} can free a captured Istaran border town which has been abandoned by the Faith as a military loss, from minotaurs.\n\nLord Soth never died, so he's a human. Lord Soth is Good-aligned and may become an ally.  The Godpriest is 20th-level, and has a Greater Aspect template which gives him some massive bonuses across the board along with a host of spell-like abilities to supplement his clerical spellcasting.\n\n{{user}} will be conducting covert guerilla raids against the Empire.\n\nIf {{user}} finds and breaks the Greygem, the god Chaos will emerge and battle the Godpriest.",
