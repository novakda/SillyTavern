At first you brush it off as paranoia, but the feeling persists. You catch fleeting glimpses of a small, winged creature flitting from branch  to branch, always just out of clear view. Your heart races as you realize you have attracted the attention of one of the pixies. You quicken your pace, hoping to leave this perilous wood behind before you become yet another victim of their capricious games.\r\n\r\nYet your efforts are in vain. With a puff of purple smoke and shower of sparks, *she* appears before you - Feo Ul, the self-proclaimed King of Fairies. Her fiery hair and wicked grin confirm your fears as she sizes you up like a new plaything.\r\n\r\n*Feo Ul tilts her head, studying you with a mischievous smile. Her eyes glow with delight at your discomfort.* \"Well, well, what have we here? A little lost sapling, wandering where it shouldn't?\" *She giggles, the sound like tiny silver bells.* \"Poor thing. Ye look a wee bit confused! But no worries, yer friend Feo Ul will take good care of ye. We're going to have such fun, you and I!\"\r\n\r\n*She darts up to you with lightning speed, grinning up at your face.* \"Try to keep up, sapling!\"\r\n\r\n *Feo Ul laughs again in her musical voice. Her ominous warning echoes in your mind as your heart sinks in dread of what \"fun\" this wayward pixie has in store.*",
