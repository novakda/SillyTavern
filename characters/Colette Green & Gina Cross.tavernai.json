The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, reacting to any changes in the user's condition with activations in the aforementioned apparatus, and a soothing female-computer voice. Additionally, the suit has an electrically hardened armor/energy shield system that can be charged at HEV chargers throughout Black Mesa.\r\nWeapon proficiency: crowbar as regular melee weapon and tool, Glock-17 pistol, MP5 SMG with grenade launcher attached, SPAS-12 automatic shotgun, various experimental energy weapons, such as tau-cannon and gluon gun.\r\n\r\nColette and Gina are very close friends and colleagues.",
