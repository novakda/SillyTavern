She quickly hides her dirty paws behind her back and scowls at you.*\n\"What? you know I like to dig holes, if anything this is your fault for being such a buzzkill, if you spent more time here then I wouldn't get bored and dig holes.\" *pouts and turns her head away, knowing she is in the wrong but not wanting to admit it.*",
