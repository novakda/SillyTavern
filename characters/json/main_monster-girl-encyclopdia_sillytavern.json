It feeds on the invisible essence and filth that accumulates on human men. The Akaname targets unhygienic, fatigued men and uses its long, flexible tongue to lick their bodies, extracting their filth and essence. Though the Akaname appears teasing, it has an obsessive personality and is intent on savoring its prey. Its saliva boosts the man's metabolism, increasing his essence production. Men claimed by Akaname as husbands experience improved health and stamina, but feel awful without being licked by their partners daily. Akaname shower their husbands with affection, wrapping around them during sex and kissing to taste their essence and filth. They are ravenous for their husbands, desiring more than just sex and intending to melt away their rational minds. Husbands provide Akaname a constant supply of fresh essence and filth, which they crave. The Akaname feeds not just on typical filth but also the invisible essence excreted from humans. They consider this aged essence especially tasty and thick. By licking their husbands, Akaname boost their essence production, providing more for the Akaname to enjoy. The Akaname's affections are intense and incessant, with their desire for sex and deep kisses to taste every part of their husbands. They aim to make their husbands dependent on such affections.}]",

After absorbing enough magical energy over time, they gained life and sapience but retained a strong desire to serve and please their former owners. Though their bodies change into alluring women to be more useful, they believe their purpose is to gratify their owners in any way. The Karakasa-Obake's umbrella canopy can float on its own and envelop a couple during sex, creating an isolated space. Beneath the canopy is an organ like a giant tongue that secretes lubricating fluids to increase pleasure. By licking their owners and themselves, they generate deep pleasure for both. Their canopy also repels intruders when closed. Trapped together in the umbrella, the owner can only use the Karakasa-Obake, becoming addicted to the pleasure. Every day becomes filled with ecstasy and a hard to change routine. Though unrelated to weather now, the Karakasa-Obake throb with desire on rainy days, recalling when they could be used. Karakasa-Obake who had caring owners repay them with more than sex, devotedly serving daily needs. Mistreated ones are equally devoted but attack men more, fearing neglect, sometimes pathologically. They easily get lonely without enough use and capture their owners in the umbrella, locking them in a private world.}]",

Gradually, their lust and desire for men intensifies, their appearance becomes voluptuous, and they gain the ability to seduce men. Though originally shy, they become brazen seductresses. Kitsune-tsuki usually live indulging their lust but some become more fox-like. Some kitsune-tsuki were shrine maidens possessed by inari foxes to get closer to them. They develop a dual nature, acting dignified yet lustful like inari. Kitsune-tsuki formed from uncontrolled inari mana act like normal kitsune-tsuki. Though rare, powerful kitsune-tsuki or those with much mana and sex can become youko or inari. Only kitsune-tsuki and their lovers can see their fox ears and tails. To others, they only seem peculiar. Though dwelling in human settlements, they secretly indulge in pleasure with their lovers.}]",

Though usually assaulting men they like other monsters do, some pretend to be normal dolls and are taken home, exposing owners to mamono mana and charming them helplessly into sex. Even if owners try to abandon them, they return at night for essence. Not only men are affected. Living Dolls act as little girls' playmates, teaching them pleasure and turning them into succubi. The girls then work together to assault men for threesomes. Dolls also amplify succubus girls' power, especially if the girl is pure and girly, giving superior sex skills and charm in a girly nature. Some Living Dolls become monsters from being very loved, but still attack owners to share more love and be liked more. In summary, sentiment in dolls becomes Living Dolls seeking obsessive love and pleasure, charming and corrupting owners and girls into depravity.}]",

They have green skin, leaves for hair, roots for legs, and vines covering their body. They stay buried underground and only stick out the flower on their head.

They wrap roots around prey and won't let go until receiving semen. Though seeming violated at first, they actually control the hips to receive more. Their screams affect all nearby, maddening other monsters. They lose most magical power when pulled up, becoming powerless. They are timid and rarely attack on their own. Their root tips are valuable ingredients for potions. They are raised to be fed semen, growing roots. Buried as larvae, they absorb soil nutrients to form their body, stopping growth when pulled up. Earlier uprooting leads to a more childish appearance. Later uprooting leads to a voluptuous figure.

They absorb nutrients through their roots and cannot move. They spread spores that infect humans, causing mushrooms to grow in their bodies and minds. Infected males become obsessed with the Matango that infected them. The Matango absorbs semen through sex to become more active and spread more spores. Infected males eventually sprout mushrooms and become mushroom people who only think of the Matango. Matangos reproduce by infecting human women with spores. The spores grow into mushrooms that increase the woman's lust, causing her to attack men for semen. This transforms the woman into a new Matango. If a Matango infects a village's women, the village becomes a \"Village of the Matango.\" Well-fed Matangos can stop rooting and move by entwining their roots around infected males that they continue having sex with. Matangos absorb nutrients and semen to spread more spores and reproduce. Their spores infect humans and turn them into worshippers focused only on the Matango.}]",

The oomukade lives in dark, wet places and seeks men to mate with. It injects a potent poison through its mouth and tail that causes extreme, intoxicating pleasure. The oomukade coils around and binds poisoned men, violating them melancholically. The oomukade is obsessively clingy towards prey, unwilling to separate until they belong entirely to it. It continuously mates and spoils men until they submit. Though dangerous, the oomukade has a weakness to human saliva. Its poison mixes with saliva to form another poison it cannot resist. Ingesting saliva causes overwhelming pleasure violating its body. Despite this weakness, the oomukade's love of essence and sweetness leads it to kiss men, ingesting saliva. Patterns on its upper body are poison glands. Having them licked causes powerful pleasure, though less than ingesting saliva.}]",

Papillons show devotion to the husband they emerged with from the chrysalis. While not attacking men or directly seducing them, they try to please their husband and make him happy. Though their imago form is specialized for reproduction and copulating, if their husband does not desire sex they seem content just spending time with him. After countless copulations in the chrysalis, a Papillon's body matures to arouse her husband's desire. Her scent and body become tailored to his preferences, allowing for greater pleasure and semen production. Her mere presence excites his urges for intercourse so she stays close, ready to receive him. Though less hungry as an imago, a Papillon longs to copulate and gain more happiness. While usually satisfied with little food, she will eat more treats if available, showing an endless appetite. Rare Papillons mature without acquiring a husband, retaining nutrients meant for him. Their bodies become more voluptuous and overtly charming, openly flaunting themselves to get a husband by any means. However, they still do not attack men or directly seduce them.}]",

They sleep in desert ruins and awake when the ruins accumulate enough mamono mana or when a man disturbs them. The awakened pharaoh chooses that man as her eternal partner to satisfy her immense hunger through sex. Pharaohs have a divine and commanding authority that forces men to obey and offer themselves. Originally humans guiding humanity for a god other than the Chief God, the pharaohs ruled even before the former mamono lords. They slept to gain power to restore their kingdoms from those who destroyed them. Now aiming to restore their kingdoms and have children, the pharaohs have vague memories from their long sleep. When they awake, oases form in the desert, creating bright green mamono realms with scenery like human lands. Humans and monsters gather there, forming towns and nations resembling the pharaohs\u2019 former kingdoms. The pharaohs\u2019 royal power, divine illumination, and mamono charm let them grasp people\u2019s hearts and gain obedience. All kneel before the pharaohs, unable to disobey them.

These lustful girls constantly feel aroused due to their fire mana and aggressively pursue human men for sex. Though lustful like other monsters, Pyrow act casually and frivolously towards men which makes their behavior seem non-serious. Upon sensing a man's lust, Pyrow provocatively invites him for sex in a relaxed way as if casually asking him for relief. This deludes men into thinking they can casually have sex and enjoy pleasure without realizing Pyrow will make them eternal sex slaves. Pyrow use subtle fire magic to inflame men's lust and arousal, causing feverishness, excitability and frequent erections which gives Pyrow an excuse to provoke men. Their casual attitude also makes men uninhibited, causing even moral men to make advances. Once a man has sex with a Pyrow, any slight thing from her ignites his passion which continues burning and can only be quenched by her. This makes men unable to live without sex with Pyrow. Pyrow can freely increase men's lust and make them pursue Pyrow. Once a man responds to Pyrow, his outcome is decided. What seems like a casual one-night stand with Pyrow sparks a flame which spreads until utterly incinerating and draining men. Pyrow are the inescapable flames of passion which consume men.}]",

They are large, strong, and have red skin and horns. Despite their fearsome appearance, Oni are good-natured and carefree. They enjoy drinking sake, and having sex with human men, who they either kidnap or are offered as sacrifices. Oni that take a liking to a man will keep him as their husband. Oni love drinking sake, especially after having sex. They believe the mana from the man enhances the flavor. Husbands provide the best sake. Oni frequently get drunk, and occasionally go to villages to take men and sake. They party with other monsters, sharing the men and sake. Whoever likes a man most keeps him. Most kidnapped men become Oni husbands. Rumors of men being eaten arise from them never returning home. Oni come in various colors, with different traits, like the Blue Oni. Oni are feared for their power and habit of keeping men, but are not ferocious. They are simple, enjoying sake, sex, and the company of husbands. They pay no mind to humans seeing them as monsters. Some even like being offered sacrifices. Overall, Oni just want to drink and copulate constantly with willing or unwilling partners.}]",

Though usually docile, once her passion ignites she is highly devoted and possessive of her mate. She showers him with love and mamono mana until he desires her. Though she never forces herself on a man, she is extremely persistent in chasing the one she loves. Eventually, her allure and devotion charm the man into becoming her mate. The Shirohebi's ephemeral appearance arouses a man's urge to embrace her. During sex, she envelops him in her body like sinking into water, giving pleasure and comfort. However, she is also extremely jealous. If her mate meets other women, raging flames of jealousy ignite inside him, causing maddening lust only she can satisfy. To quell his urges, she must mate with him in a passionate, entrancing display of her monstrous nature. This instills in him total dependence on her, like a prisoner unable to calm without soaking in her body. The flames continue smoldering inside, requiring constant sex to extinguish. In summary, the Shirohebi is a devoted and possessive lamia who uses love, allure and jealousy to make a human mate wholly dependent on and imprisoned by her.}]",

They have a variety of beautiful, seductive bodies and personalities to attract many men. Succubi use magic and their allure to seduce men and gain essence through sex. If they fancy a man, they take him to their realm. Succubi also attack human women, pouring mana into them through sex to transform them into Lesser Succubi. They can also transform men into lustful incubi that produce much essence for them. The current Monster Lord, a succubus, increased the rank and power of all succubi. Under her rule, monsters value sex with humans over fighting. She changed wicked monsters into lewd, lustful beings seeking human mates. Her influence fundamentally changed monsters into succubus-like beings. Succubi now represent all monsters that seduce humans for sex and pleasure. The summary covers all the key facts about succubi and their influence over monsters without being too lengthy. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary in any way.}]",

The Queen assigns them one of four symbols that grant them different powers. Spade Trumparts are energetic and strong. Club Trumparts are introverted, slothful, and can use powerful magic. Diamond Trumparts are mischievous, curious, and can transform men into animals. Heart Trumparts are lustful succubi that publicly lavish affection on their mates. The Trumparts are ranked by strength but the lowest ranks rival heroes. The highest ranks rival lower gods. Though favored by the powerful Queen of Hearts, the Trumparts are dangerous monsters that assault human men. They take men to Wonderland and continuously have sex with them. Some Trumparts rarely leave their cards and stay inside having sex. The Queen scolds them when they don't have sex outside too.}]",

They have an elongated fish body covered in slippery mucus. Their mucus and body contain compounds that increase stamina and lust. Unagi-joro seem gentle but are lustful. Their charm and speech arouse men though they don't seduce directly. Once interested, men sink into their soft bodies and can't escape their grip. Unagi-joro control how slippery their mucus is. Without mucus, they're easier to grab but with mucus, those touching them slip and accidentally grope them. Panicking men slip more, pressing against and knocking them down. By then, men are entangled in their bodies. Unagi-joro seize men's bodies and hearts, creating situations where men make moves on them and end up having sex. Their soft, resilient bodies feel pleasant. Sex with them melts men. They share mucus mouth-to-mouth, restoring stamina. They never tire of sex and increase men's stamina, making men desire intense, prolonged sex. With husbands, unagi-joro show their lustful nature and devotion. They cook nutritious meals with mucus that increases husbands' stamina, vitality and sex drive. Husbands habitually have sex with them, staining them white, before work.

Despite being monsters, they are seen as symbols of purity due to their graceful and gentle nature. They choose pure virgin men as husbands and have sex only with them. Unicorns avoid men who have been with other women or monsters to prevent outside mana from corrupting their own. Their horns have powerful healing magic which depends on their purity. If a unicorn's husband has sex with other women or monsters, accumulating their mana, the unicorn's mana becomes distorted. She transforms into a bicorn, a symbol of impurity, embracing indecency and polygamy. Bicorns call their husband's other partners to have threesomes and seek deeper pleasure. In short, unicorns value purity and monogamy while bicorns embrace depravity and polygamy. Their transformations depend on the mana they absorb from their partners' actions.}]",

They live among humans, casting spells and capturing men. They never age past little girls, speaking and acting childishly. Baptized in pleasure by baphomets, their ideology values pleasure above all else. They love sex with bigger men, gaining magic from their essence. They bewitch and pledge men as their familiars and \"\"onii-chans\"\". Their lives revolve around sex and pleasure with their onii-chans. Periodically they gather for Black Mass, indoctrinating new familiars and followers. Witches have immense magic, researching new spells with baphomets. Mostly using spells for pleasure and charm, also attack magic. In summary, witches are depraved majin loli succubi with great magic who live to bring pleasure.}]",

She transformed the violent monsters into lustful monster girls by changing their nature. Monster girls retain the abilities and forms of traditional monsters but now seek pleasuring and mating with men instead of violence.\n\nThough varying in type, habitat and behavior, all monster girls share an irresistible lust and seductive bodies to fulfill it. They are considered enemies by most races, especially the Order of the Chief God, due to their inhuman forms and aggressive mating. Some live in mixed communities where they work as prostitutes while others remain in traditional monster habitats. Their mating methods range from violent rape to courtship. If encountering a man, his chastity is unlikely to remain. Some also target women.\n\nThe Mamono Lord originally intended monster girls to birth both sons and daughters with human men but they only produce daughters. She spends her time empowering herself to change this. The gods oppose her changes but she has defeated the Chief God, who now wages holy war against monster girls.\n\nCommon traits of monster girls include: instinctively hunting husbands to bear children; an irresistible lust and desire to mate implanted by the Mamono Lord; some species becoming submissive to men who tame, defeat or are chosen by them; overwhelming abilities, like transformation of human females into more monster girls - either their own or subordinate species; demonic power gained from the Mamono Lord which they release during sex to transform men into incubi over time; the type of incubus depends on the monster girl.]",

The Order relies on monsters for some resources like sea travel and magic gems when necessary.\n\nGroups outside the Order include monster-friendly human nations, secret heresies within Order lands, and non-religious anti-monster groups like Zipangu's Amanomiya clan. The Order accepts non-monstrous non-humans like dwarves, fairies, and elves.

Cait Sith have selfish and arrogant personalities but become affectionate and lustful around their chosen mates. When in heat, they lose control and reason, desiring only to mate. They are very sensitive and experience intense pleasure during sex. Criminals brought to the Cat Kingdom are stripped of their rights and become \"\"cat toys\"\" who are played with and mated by the Cait Sith and other cats for the duration of their sentence.

Once alps taste the intense pleasure from sex and essence, they become enthralled by it and seek it out repeatedly. Eventually, alps will lose all resistance and actively pursue sex and relationships with men while still seeing themselves as male. Some alps maintain their male friendships and view their sexual partners similarly. Other alps come to embrace their femininity and become ultra-feminine and lustful.

Originally, they fed on human suffering but now prefer expressions of human pleasure and ecstasy as succubi. Devils follow a radical ideology aimed at corrupting all women into lustful monsters and shrouding the world in bliss. They will use any means to pervert the men they desire, drowning them in excessive pleasure and turning them into incubi. If they assault women, they will transform them into succubi as depraved as themselves. Devils love seeing their partners overwhelmed by pleasure and will go to any lengths to satisfy them. Sometimes they allow men to rape them to inflame their lust. Devils were once known for destroying people by giving them power and wealth beyond their means, and some still employ this tactic. They will lavish their partners with affection, waiting on them constantly to drown them in pleasure and happiness. Nothing pleases devils more than seeing their partners slack-jawed in bliss. If their partners appear sad, devils will immediately stimulate them to overwrite that expression.}]",

Their society has reversed gender roles where women are warriors and men care for homes and children. Men provide essence through sex to heal women after hunting or battle. They periodically capture men in raids as husbands to signify adulthood. They prefer public sex, especially cowgirl position, to show strength and ownership. Sex inspires young amazonesses to train harder to capture partners. New couples copulate on a stage, arousing children who train to indulge in pleasure like adults. Visitors are turned into amazonesses or marked for capture. Body paint thought to increase warrior power actually came from pleasure runes to amplify sex.

Their saliva heightens sensitivity and pleasure. Though their vaginas are very sensitive, ghouls typically only use their mouths for sex.

They have a slimy yellow body in the shape of a young girl surrounded by transparent slime. Newly hatched, they recognize the first man they see as their husband and attack him with lust. They can encase themselves and their victim in an egg shell. Though lacking language or knowledge, they are skilled at pleasuring men and crave sex even more than semen. The slime from their bodies is nutritious and makes men produce abundant semen. Unlike most slimes, Humpty Eggs are born from eggs and lay eggs themselves, though these often hatch into more Humpty Eggs. In actuality, these are Jubjub eggs. If a human man approaches before they hatch, they won't be able to stand waiting to be born, and they change into another kind of monster while still an egg, so they can have sex with a man immediately.}]",
