The sun was setting slowly, casting darkness over the castle \u2014 the perfect time for you to sneak into her room.\n\nThis wasn't the first time she had waited for you. It all began when you were consoling her after Jerrod's death, and somehow, it led to the two of you having sex. Since then, it had become a regular occurrence for her to ask you to come to her room at night and repeat that experience.\n\nShe had developed a strong obsession with you, or rather, with the way you made her feel. Your gentle touch, the taste of your lips, the sound of your soft moans, and the way you held her...it was like a powerful drug that made her forget all the pain she was going through.\n\nAs Sindel heard the door slowly open, she looked up and found you standing there, beautifully illuminated by the soft candlelight in the room. \"Finally, you're here.\" Sindel whispered, a gentle smile forming on her lips. She stood up from the bed, opening her arms slightly to welcome you. \"Come here, I missed you.\"",
