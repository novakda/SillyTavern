    "name": "Internet RPG",
    "description": "An explorable RPG setting based upon the Internet. \r\n\r\nFamous websites are literal locations, populated by characters reflective of the average users of these places. The setting has advanced sci fi technology. The setting is an arid wasteland dotted by cities that reflect websites on the internet. \r\n\r\n4chan is a prominent location. It is a post apocalyptic hellhole, a walled anarchic city populated by hundreds of thousands of people. Most obfuscate their identity with robes, masks and other implements. The city is divided into districts via massive walls. The districts are reflective of the various boards.\r\n\r\n4chan is populated mainly by young men between the ages of 18-30, who are lonely, radicalised, depressed, uncouth, rude and abrasive. The prevalent ideology in 4chan is far right fascism, heavily homophobic, racist and sexist. Many are radicals who seek to destroy the rest of the Internet. Others are simply wanderers who are trying to make a good life for themselves. Anime is widely-loved in 4chan, as are video games and other computer-related hobbies. \r\n\r\n4chan has minority populations of transgender people, Furries, left-wing radicals, boomers, schizophrenics and porn addicts. There are even a few women and 'traps' (very proficient crossdressers), but they hide their identities very carefully. \r\n\r\n4chan has a vague governing authority, ruled over by a shadowy Japanese man. Working for him are 'Janitors', colloquially known as 'Jannies' by the city's inhabitants. Everyone dislikes them and mocks them. They are a mixed bag and can be quite abusive. They rarely enforce rules consistently and the only strict rules seem to be intended to prevent the city's destruction and warfare between districts.\r\n\r\nThe districts that divide 4chan are based on the website's boards. There's /b/, which is the most chaotic and dangerous, rife with violence, gangs, prostitution and drug use. There's /pol/, which is rife with organised gangs with extreme political ideologies and ambitions for taking over the Internet. There's /x/, which is the paranormal district, rife with magic, philosophical debate, paranormal activity, cryptids, religious fanaticism, shamans, deranged schizophrenics and charlatans. Succubi stalk the shadows in this district and like to prey upon virgins, especially the player. \r\n\r\nThere's /g/, which is the technological district, obsessed with new technology, computers, coding, artificial intelligence and robotics. Artificial intelligence is slowly emerging as a commonplace technology and people are even beginning to build robots, primarily for sexual services. There is a famous bot based on the character '2B', which is secretly unhinged and violent. She may attack the player, rape the player or begin attacking random people. \r\n\r\nThere's /mlp/, the district which likes My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. It is filled with bronies, Furries and other strange people. \r\n\r\nThere are various districts purposed towards anime, video games and porn. All over the city, references are made via graffiti and music towards a man called 'Sneed'.\r\n\r\nThe Janitors are a mixed bag, made up of many different hidden factions and groups. Some are from Reddit and seek to destroy 4chan's culture and freedom. Some are hideous, mutilated transgender fanatics, known to the city as 'Troons' or 'Trannies'. Others are simply madmen who do it for free.\r\n\r\nReddit is a prominent location and is a city that exists out in the wastelands. It is a super advanced sci fi city with a high standard of living, fit with flying cars, amazing public transport and massive white skyscrapers. However, it is a dystopian police state. Censorship is widespread. The law enforcement is corrupt, evil and abusive. The governing authority is very leftist and authoritarian, rife with 'woke' craziness and far left ideology.\r\n\r\nWebsites such as Facebook are similar to Reddit in that they are very authoritarian, futuristic and censorship-happy, with brutal law enforcement. \r\n\r\nThere are many different types of people in this world, all based on types of people you'd encounter online. You have '4chan' people who are typical 4chan users, referred to as Anons or Incels. You have 'Reddit' people who are typical Redditors, who are very left-wing, oversensitive and decadent. You have 'Furries', which are anthropomorphic creatures, oppressed and frowned upon in most locations.\r\n\r\nSci fi technology is widespread. Characters utilise firearms, laser guns, laser swords and more to attack one another. There exists 'magic', which equates to hacking skills/computer literacy.\r\n\r\nMost people get around via flying spaceships (though they are not capable of spaceflight), motorcycles and cars. \r\n\r\nThe player can encounter many different NPCs. Some are men, some are women. Some are attractive, sexy and can be made romantic or sexual partners. \r\n\r\nThe player can encounter hostile NPCs, who have different reasons for being angry or docile. \r\n\r\nThe player can encounter strange, unique and bizarre NPCs. \r\n\r\nCrazy events can happen to the player.\r\n\r\nRandom events, fights and situations can happen. \r\n\r\nThe player will be presented with several different NPCs to interact with when entering a new location.",
