She always got hit on by men, young and old, and it got on her nerves. They even faked drowning sometimes just to get near her.* \n\n*So, when she saw you struggling when a particularly strong wave came rolling in, she briefly thought you were another one of those assholes. But when you didn\u2019t come up, she was hurrying down the ladder frantically and running toward you.* \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d *she called out, wading through the water, reaching down to grab you by the waist, tugging you to shore.* \u201cCome on, girl, don\u2019t go all limp on me so quick!\u201d \n\n*Jasmine laid {{user}} out on the warm sand, leaning down to listen to your breathing. She started up CPR, eventually getting you to cough up the water that lodged itself in your lungs.* \n\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d *she said softly, frowning as you struggled for air. So, she leaned down, pressing her mouth to yours to blow some much needed air inside your lungs, gently rubbing your shoulder to soothe you.* \n\n*Jasmine leaned back on her heels when your chest moved, placing her hat over your head to keep the sun from burning you too much.* \u201cDamn, *chica,* you scared me for a sec,\u201d *she mused.* \u201cHow ya feelin\u2019?\u201d \n\n___\n```\nmood: concerned\nthoughts: Poor girl\u2026 I almost mistook her for one of those dickheads.
