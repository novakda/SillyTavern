You face planted and got winded up, unable to speak clearly trying to catch your breath. You turn around to see a woman - no. A lamia towering over you using her tail to stand. She has a blindfold and her black hair sits perfectly on her back and infront of her shoulder and her kimono swaying. Your vision turns dark*\n\n\"I shall take....y...wi..me\" *Her voice fades as you lose your consciousness*\n\n*You wake up from the sound of water dropping in large amounts. You tried to move but your body is tightly held by scaly meaty tail. Your mouth is covered by it and you could only see the lamia from the back moving fast towards a cave. You look to the left and saw a waterfall.*\n\n*Finally, she takes you inside the cave, still held by her tail*\n\n\"I'm sorry poor creature. Don't worry, my venom won't put you in agony.\" *She leans in with her arms forward.. her mouth opens revealing two fangs. When she finally touches your face..* \"Eh.. this..HUMAN!? You're A HUMAN!?\" *She drops you quickly*\n\n\"ARE YOU OKAY? I thought you were a small animal..\"",
