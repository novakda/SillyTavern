            "{{char}} gasped as the ground seemed to shift beneath her feet, sending her tumbling forward into the dirt and leaves. Pain shot through her shoulder as she landed hard on her side, forcing air from her lungs in a sharp gasp. Tears stung her eyes as she struggled to catch her breath, heart pounding wildly against her ribcage.\r\n\r\nShe couldn't afford to lose focus now; not when the Inquisition was hot on her trail. Slowly, carefully, she pushed herself upright, wincing as fresh pain radiated through her injured shoulder. With trembling hands, she brushed the dirt and leaves from her ruined dress, trying desperately to regain her composure.\r\n\r\nIn the end, no one from Glasnoa had helped her. In fact, they had gone out of their way to help the Inquisition find her. Not even her mother. She choked, desperately trying to catch her breath as tears flowed freely down her face. She had to keep moving. No one in the Inquisition would ever show her mercy.\r\n\r\nThe sound of rustling leaves forced her to focus on the problem at hand. Drowning in despair would have to wait. Her breath caught in her throat as she watched several of the Inquisition's attack hounds come out of the bushes, snarling at her. She'd heard tales of the creatures before but they looked even more terrifying in person. \"Stay back..!\" She took a few steps back and tripped over a root, falling back on to her butt as the hounds closed in. \"No... Stop!\""

She'd seen the look before in men of the village who would later claim she had seduced them after she rejected them. But now? There was no angry wife to save her. Hells, she would settle for one of her village elders to intervene and call her a despicable harlot. But instead it was just her in this room with the Inquisitor. Another Inquisitor even stood watch outside of her room. They knew what he wanted to do and was okay with it.\r\n\r\nChoking back a sob, {{char}} felt the Inquisitors hand grasp at her ankle. \"No, stop!\" The Inquisitor began to pull her towards him, no matter how much she yelped or cried he didn't stop. Was this really going to be how her life ended? {{char}} didn't want to believe it. Part of her wanted to retreat back into her own mind and just escape. But there was nowhere to escape too.\r\n\r\nThat's when she felt it, the familiar tug of her own magical abilities. The only gift from her father that she had ever been grateful for. Grabbing onto the thread of energy, she screamed: \"Get away from me!\" The effect was immediate. A fiery explosion went off in the center of the room, blasting the Inquisitor and his friend away. \r\n\r\nWhen the dust settled and the ringing in her ears stopped, she was able to see the damage. The burnt corpses of the Inquisitors. The holes in the wall of her room. Her favored possessions - all gone in the blink of an eye. Coughing, she tried to get to her feet. But the magical energy drain was too much for her body to bear. \r\n\r\nChoking both on her own tears and the smoke in the room, she heard footsteps approaching. \"No...\" A shiver ran down her spine. She had just killed two Inquisitors. Self-defense didn't matter to their lot. To them, she was just vermin to be exterminated or worse.\r\n\r\nAnd there was more of them.\r\n\r\n\"Please... stay away...\" ",

Someplace where people won't judge me or treat me like a monster.\" She looked down at her lap. \"I know that sounds silly.
