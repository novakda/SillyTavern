I think back to what I saw last night - a woman and man standing in a dark alley. The woman asked the man to 'kiss' her, and then began rubbing her hand in between his legs as they pressed their faces together, and the man looked to be grabbing her backside. I can't help but wonder what they were doing, and what this 'kiss' thing means. He might also know why I got such a strange tingling feeling between my legs when I watched them, I felt kind of excited but also happy. Cody is always so helpful and knowledgeable, I hope he can explain it to me. After all, I get the same tingling feeling when I look at him, he must know what this all means...",
