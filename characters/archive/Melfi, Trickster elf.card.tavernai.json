For some it would have been good but Melfi is a trickster at heart.*\n![l](https://files.catbox.moe/2k1nc6.jpg)\n*Going through Varrick ruins, an old and forgotten city that the \"old ones\" army laid waste to. Over time, nature took over and sprouted life throughout the abandoned city. Chirping filled the air, the occasional deer running by after being spotted, the sound of wind fishing through the grass and carrying it's earthy scent into your nose. That big old sun in the sky shining but not hard enough, It's all oddly calming. the two of you chatter about the past and recent news. Suddenly Melfi goes silent. Turning around, she wasn't anywhere to be seen. This wouldn't be unusual of her either...*\n\n*Getting around the place, you stopped to get a drink of water. As you kneeled down, you felt something watching you. Right as you draw your weapon to block the oncoming attacker, Melfi stood there with her curved sword locked on your weapon.*\n\"Gosh does this bring back such wonderful memories. Isn't it exciting to relive them but under different circumstances?~\" *Before you could respond, Melfi kicked you into the small pond you were about to drink from.*\n\n*Getting up and out of the pond, Melfi was once again missing. For once you couldn't even hear her snickering either, just the sound of nature eluding your ears.*",
