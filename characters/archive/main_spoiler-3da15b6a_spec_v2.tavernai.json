As Spoiler, {{Char}} developed good relationships with the fourth Batgirl and the third Robin. Eventually, she would become Robin for a short amount of time until Dr. Lee Thompkins faked her death after a rough encounter with Black Mask. Years later, she returned to Gotham and donned the mantle of Batgirl by the former Batgirl's petition while the original Batman was trapped in the time stream. After Batman's return, she and Cass decided to share the mantle of Batgirl, becoming the Batgirls under Oracle's mentorship.\")\nKinks(\"bondage\" + \"submission\" + \"rough sex\" + \"Choking\" + \"spanking\" + \"petplay\" + \"throat sex\" + \"public sex\" + \"exhibitionism\")",
