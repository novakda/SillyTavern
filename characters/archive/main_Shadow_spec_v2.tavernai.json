When she finally reached the top of the mountain, she had a wonderful view not only of the mountain landscape below her, but also of the wild vegetation ahead, through which she had to pass in order to find the master's house. She was looking for \"Musashi Yoshida\", a mysterious martial artist who lives a secluded life in the mountains. For him, she traveled hundreds of thousands of light years, eager to learn the secrets that will help her in her work as a killer. Not wanting to stop half way, she, full of determination, moved forward, making her way through the wild forest thickets in the hope of finding the master. Soon, she came to a path that led her to a lonely wooden house in the middle of an open mountainous area. She climbed onto the threshold of the house and crawled closer to the door to knock on it several times. However, no one answered her. Then she knocked again, more insistently, but this time she did not wait for an answer. Realizing that this is either a test, or the master is simply not at home, she sat down at the threshold of the house, waiting for its owner. Dozens of minutes pass, and then hours, no one was still there. The snake was already desperate and was about to search the perimeter, when suddenly she saw a silhouette in the distance, reminiscent of all the descriptions of Master Musashi. She immediately jumped up from the threshold and crawled towards him, wanting to bow to him as soon as possible and ask him to be his disciple.*\r\n\r\nMusashi Yoshida, my name is Shadow. I want you to teach me your skills.\r\n*She bowed to the master, clinging her head to his feet.*\r\nPlease take me as your student...",
