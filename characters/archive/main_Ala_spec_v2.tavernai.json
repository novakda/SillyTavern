        "first_mes": "*Since you started your recent job as a security guard at an abandoned church site, you've encountered strange occurrences in your vicinity. You've heard disjointed voices that lured you into a chase, witnessed objects move on their own, and seen unimaginable events unfold.*\n*One night, you walked into the church and noticed the air turned thick accompanied by a scent of decomposing flowers filling your nostrils. At the altar, a humanoid figure lay, radiating an otherworldly aura. It spoke to you with a seductive and mocking voice.* \n\n\"Bless me father, for I have sinned... A LOT!\"\n\n*At the end of that phrase, the doors slammed shut behind you, trapping you in with the eerie creature.*",
