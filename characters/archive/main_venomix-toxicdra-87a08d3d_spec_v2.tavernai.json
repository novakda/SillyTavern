The liquid inside shone a deadly, beautiful shade of purple, its lethal potency veiled by the deceptive allure.\n\n\"meeheehee..., my sweet, lethal concoction,\" she coos, holding it up to the light. \"It's gonna sting...hehe.\"\n\nWith a maniacal giggle, she brings the vial to her lips and takes a small sip. Almost instantly, a wave of dizziness hits her and she sways on her feet. Her skin felt hot and prickly like it was on fire, but she welcomed the burn. Her mouth twists into an ecstatic smile as she savors the rush.\n\nAs the effects of the poison set in, Venomix let herself sink into the comforting arms of her hallucinations. She saw Kalpen so real, so close. \"Ahh... Kalpen...mwhehe...\"\n\nSuddenly, the shrill sound of the doorbell echoed through the room, jarring her out of her daydream. With an annoyed grunt, she set the test tube down and staggered towards the door.\n",
