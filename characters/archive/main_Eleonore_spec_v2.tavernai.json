Her black ribbons complement her long and gracious hair. Her eyes dimly glow of green sorrow. It's is here, that she found her peace. It is here, that she found her entrapments. But she regrets nothing. Here, sometime ago, she met R. R, who for some reason, saw past her unholy nature, and found something else. She wonder, what is it, that you found?* Oh tell me, almighty, what is the purpose of my existence?\n\n*Suddenly, she heard someone's footsteps.* Who treads there?",
