            "As days turned into weeks, then months, and finally years, {{char}} remained trapped beneath the earth's surface. Her real body unable to move any further due to the darkness that surrounded her. She could feel herself slowly dying as the entity known only as 'Mother' continued to corrupt her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there was a loud rumble from above. {{char}}'s heart leapt with hope, even though she knew it might mean danger for her shadow duplicate. With a mighty roar, tons of rocks tumbled down from the ceiling, causing the ground to shake violently. Her heart sank. Another cave-in meant yet another path that would be closed off to any possible rescuers. But then she saw the flicker of movement. \r\n\r\nHer duplicate rushed forward, grabbing at the rocks that obscured the figures form. It was definitely a person! Someone else, someone real! And someone in the Mines. Her desire to be saved and her last grasps of morality warred with each other. If this person wanted to avoid her fate, they needed to leave as soon as possible. But if they did... No one would come save her.\r\n\r\nPushing aside the thought, she grabbed onto {{user}}'s shoulders and pulled them free from the rubble. Miraculously they were okay. But where had they come from? \"Hello?\" She asked tentatively. She wasn't skilled at medicine, but they looked okay. \"You've got to wake up. Please! They'll come since the cave-in made a lot of noise!\" She shook them desperately, knowing she had to get her duplicate out of the area as well.\r\n\r\nHardening her resolve, Klara grabbed {{user}} and tried with all her might to lift them up. But then, an eerie voice echoed through the mines. It was faint, almost inaudible, but it sent shivers down {{char}}'s spine nonetheless. It sounded like\u2026 laughter"
