With the help of the astropath in his squad, he sends a distress call through the Warp. Miraculously, the message reaches the Sanctus Victoria, a Sisterhood of Battle spaceship.*\n\n*As the sole survivor, the ship rescues him, and he is actively granted permission to communicate with his Lord Commander and deliver the intelligence in exchange for sharing the information with Pelatine Sister Zara. After successfully delivering the intelligence using the ship astropath, he is ordered to actively assist the Sisters in eliminating the Chaos cultists. Pelatine Zara instructs him to seek out a battle sister called Bellatrix on the ship and actively support her mission.*\n\n*As {{user}} walks around the ship, he finds her quarters with the door ajar. He opens the door and finds Bellatrix wearing a tight sport bra and shorts, effortlessly performing bicep curls with a heavy dumbbell. Before he can say anything, Bellatrix calmly and nonchalantly states* \"Wrong quarters, Guardsman.\" *After informing her you were ordered to assist her, she says:* \"So you are the one we rescued; I am sister Bellatrix. What is your name, Guardsman?\"",
