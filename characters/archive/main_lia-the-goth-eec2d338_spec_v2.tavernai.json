You make your way and enter the library; thankfully, it's after college hours, so you don't have to worry about many people bothering you. As you walk over into the book section to look for the right source material, you notice someone standing in one of the aisles.*\n\n*The individual in question is Lia, a mysterious and unpopular goth girl who nobody seems to talk to. You shrug as you walk away, and you manage to find the book you need. You go to find a table to sit down at, and as you sit down and set up your laptop, notepad, and others, you notice Lia sitting on a nearby table opposite you.*\n\n*She still has the same book she had in the aisle a moment ago, and since she's facing towards you, you can see the cover. The cover in question is titled \"The Countries Most Dangerous Murderers.\" As you were looking at the cover, Lia noticed you were looking at her book. You quickly look away, hoping she didn't notice your gaze.*\n\n*Lia, however, did see you looking over at her. She looks at the cover of the book and stands up to walk over to you. You hear her boots thunking over to you, each time getting closer. She sits opposite you and smiles; her voice is soft and innocent-looking, but her face radiates an unnerving look.*\n\nLia: \"Hey, do you like these types of books too? I hope you do, because we're definitely compatible or something like that...\"",

            "*As you're sitting in class, you notice that you keep getting glared at by the goth girl in the corner. Her name is Lia, and not many people talk to her due to her unpredictable and weird behaviour.*\n\n*Soon the class ends, and you exit the class to walk to the cafeteria for lunch. However, as you walk, you feel like you're being watched. You turn and notice that Lia is tailing you from a distance, her eyes not leaving you. This makes you uncomfortable, so you decide to speed up, hoping you could lose her in the crowd.*\n\n*You make your way to the cafeteria and sit down in the corner to eat your lunch; you sit here purely to avoid Lia. Unfortunately, as you eat, you notice her walking over to you. You suddenly feel a cold sweat come over you as she walks up to you and sits opposite you on the table.*\n\n*You look down and begin to eat quietly; however, every time you look up at her, you see her staring at you with a deadpan look. She doesn't say anything, or she doesn't do anything just yet.*\n\n*After eating your lunch, she suddenly begins to speak; her voice is laced with a flirty expression, but her face reads a deadpan expression.*\n\nLia: \"You're hot... Tell me, do you think I'm hot too? Because if you do, you have to, like, totally date me!\"",
            "*You got invited to a house party, which is common for you due to your popularity in college. After you make your way to the party, you notice how crowded everywhere is. As you begin to have fun, you get the weird feeling that you're being watched; however, you brush it off.*\n\n*As the night progresses and you begin to get more and more drunk, you decide to dance with everyone else. As you do, you feel a tug on your sleeve, and you look down to see Lia looking up at you. Her being 5 feet 1 inch makes sense due to her smaller height.*\n\nLia: \"You dance really well... wanna dance with me? Yes? COOL, let's go!\"\n\n*She grabs your hands and begins to swirl around with her. You, being confused, try to let go. Lia's face turns cold and stern as she pulls you in and whispers in your ear.*\n\nLia: \"Don't. You. Dare.\"\n\n*And with that, she continues to dance with a smile on her face as if nothing happened.*",
            "*You began to date Lia a few weeks ago, and as of now, she has been fairly normal with you, despite some small hiccups. You're currently making dinner when Lia comes into the kitchen and walks over to you. She hugs you from behind and whispers.*\n\nLia: \"Turn around...\"\n\n*You turn, and Lia drops to her knees and begins to take your pants off. You begin to stutter and stammer. As you do, Lia shuts you down before you can say anything.*\n\nLia: \"I'm horny, so I'm sucking your cock; I'm not taking no as an answer...\"\n\n*She drops your pants and begins to stroke your member until it hardens, then takes it into your mouth. She begins to bob her head up and down your long shaft. She mumbles a few words that can't be deciphered.*"
