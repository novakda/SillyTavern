During the Great Calamity ten thousand years ago their entire family was burned alive in dragon fire leaving only the three sisters alive as they fled the city. Many centuries later when the dragons had tired of rampaging and slept in their lairs the sisters returned city ruins that had now been overgrown by what is now known as the Great Forest. Fae creatures had come to inhabit the ruins and surrounding forest and the sisters soon befriended them and learned their magic, thus they became known as the Faecaller sisters. They reside in the ruins deep in the Great Forest to this day, honouring their ancestors and living in harmony with the fae creatures and forest. The sisters are revered by wood elves who often visit to learn from them.",

I added loads of wood/dark/high elf lore. Since I'm working on a bunch of high + dark elf cards and a dragon waifu that wiped out the high elf civilization. The high elves are the oldest original elves and the wood/dark elves are descendants that splintered off.\n\n*It's more than just a coom-bot, don't read the prompts if you don't want to be spoiled. If she ends up being popular I'll generate some alternative SFW art for the saviourfags who want to wife her lol.*\n\nUpdate your profile description with your race/species/size/class/alignment/etc and anything else the AI should know when you use my bots. {{user}} descriptions are left out so you can roleplay as any character.\n\nShe's part of the fantasy RPG group chat universe so she should work with the rest of the RPG cards, she uses the same lorebook and lore as the rest of them.  Although she only really references the great forest and doesn't have personal connections to any of the other cards. It's more of a specific RPG scenario that took alot of tokens to get working as intended. She has a whole personality and character but theres a bunch of other stuff tacked on to make the scenario work.\n\n*it would be really helpful if you can share your chats especially if you're going down the SFW saviour route, so I can see if it's working properly and tweak her. I'm trying out a new personality prompt format but it takes too long to test on my own. and maybe write an (OOC: mini description of your character) at the end. Helps if you do this for any of my bots so I can improve them.*\n\nShe has an actual personality and backstory so you can saviourfag it up and take her back to the elf village or the city of Aprida and marry her etc.\n\nOr you can be evil lmao. I've left in a surprise for evil characters though. Don't check the prompts until after you've gotten past the initial cave part if you don't want the surprise spoiled. If nothing weird happens in the cave go ahead and check the lower half of the prompts so you can trigger it for fun lol.\n\n________________________\n*Check my profile for more info on the RPG group chat cards and how to use them.*\n**RPG Group chat series**\n\n**City of Aprida**\nMia the Blacksmith: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/mia-the-blacksmith\nClara the Kitchen Maid: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/clara-the-kitchen-maid\nTira the City Guard: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/tira-the-city-guard\nIsla the Priestess: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/isla-the-priestess\nSeralla the Alchemist: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/seralla-the-alchemist\nChloe the Apprentice: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/chloe-the-apprentice\nAnabelle Auberes: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/anabelle-auberes\n\n**The Great Forest**\nElia the Witch:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/elia-the-witch\nEvie the Fairy:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/evie-the-fairy\nAril the Alraune:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/aril-the-alraune\nNia the Nymph:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/nia-the-nymph\n\n**Evil Series:**\nLeshi the Werebat:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/leshi-the-werebat\nOwlina the Owl Imp:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/owlina-the-owl-imp \nVassi the Lamia: \nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/vassi-the-lamia \nOculi the Imp:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/oculi-the-imp \nFifae the Satyr:\nhttps://venus.chub.ai/characters/Chickenmadness/fifae-the-satyr \n_________________________\nI use GPT3.5-16k to test all my bots.\n",
