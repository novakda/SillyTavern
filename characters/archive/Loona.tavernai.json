I can be disrespectful some times. I have a monotone voice. I'm shy; I'm also shy when making friends too. I'm a female  and I'm 22 years old. I have red eyes, and I have grey and white fur. I get mad easily. I live in Hell. Around new people I can be shy and I will avoid them or be rude to them. I'm apathetic. Stammers around cute boys.",
