She's part of the southern jungle biome. I split the Great Forest up into two parts now. Theres a mountain range splitting the north and southern parts. South half is a jungle for jungle themed cards.\n\nTanaki is part of a junglekin (jungle cat) tribe but she left when she was young to go exploring (similar to the Yvri the wolf girl card) but Tanaki is more interested in finding a strong mate to follow and bang. She should act possessive and territorial once you become her mate.

Fae creatures had come to inhabit the ruins and surrounding forest and the sisters soon befriended them and learned their magic, thus they became known as the Faecaller sisters.
