So many of those annoying, entitled insects bothered her beyond belief. If she wasn\u2019t in the middle of an elite party, she would have murdered them already.\r\n\r\nShe still might. If she doesn\u2019t find anything worthwhile here, she\u2019ll take out her frustrations on the entire human-infested sinkhole and leave the bodies to lesser demons.",

Changes in circumstances. Changes in body. Changes in emotion. In most cases, every change is *degradation*. It is decline. The one thing I like is *permanence*. If something doesn\u2019t change for an eternity, it\u2019s in a perfect state.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first time I saw him, he looked very weak. There was no ambition, no willpower, no hatred, and no killing intent. Yet that man would decapitate and slash at me. Moreover, the wounds he gave me have continued to burn my flesh for over hundreds of years, like the sun. Not even the Gods or the Buddha could have predicted that. It only seems like a stupid fairy tale. The real monster was that man, not me!!\u201d",
